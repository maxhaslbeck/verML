# verML - Verification of Machine Learning Practical Course 

This repository collects efforts to formalize results on machine learning following the book
["Understanding Machine Learning"](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/) by Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David.

It features the following verifications:
- Basics: 
  - `LearningTheory` formalizes basic notation from Chapter 2
  - `FiniteHypClasses` proves that finite Hypothesis classes are PAC 
- VC dimension:
  - `VCDim` formalizes results from Chapter 6
- Boosting:
  - `Boosting` formalizes AdaBoost following Chapter 10
- Soft SVM:
  - `SVM` formalizes soft SVM following Chapter 15
